# About me

This page contains information pertaining my past and current work and
educational experience.

## Education

### High school

In my pursuit of knowledge about computing systems, I first chose to study to become an IT Professional in high school at [Istituto Tecnico Industriale Statale G. Galilei](http://www.galileilivorno.gov.it), Livorno (Italy), graduating with a final mark of 100/100 in June, 2013.

In high school I learned the basics of programming, a few programming languages, commonly used programming patterns, web technologies, mobile app development, and networking. My schooling experience was also enriched by the participation to a few student competitions, which pushed me to obtain extra knowledge and competences, in addition to the ones acquired during classes.

### Bachelor years

After that, I enrolled in [University of Pisa](http://www.unipi.it) (Italy) to obtain a Bachelor Degree in [Computer Engineering](http://www.unipi.it/.php/lauree/corso/10276). During my bachelor years I expanded my knowledge of computer science, along with other engineering areas. In particular I learned about computer architectures, system programming, industrial automation and control systems.

For my bachelor's thesis, I worked on a system for the generation of dynamic and interactive crisis maps. This work, along with my weighted average grades of over 29/30, granted me a final graduation mark of 110 cum laude/110, in September, 2016.

### Master years

For my master's program I joined [Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna](http://www.santannapisa.it) in Pisa, Italy to obtain a Master of Science in [Computer Engineering and Embedded Computing Systems](http://www.santannapisa.it/en/education/masters-degree-embedded-computing-systems-call). Throughout my master's program I enhanced my knowledge of control systems and system programming. During this time I was exposed to real-time systems, mechatronics, computer architectures, and component frameworks.

For my master thesis, I developed a framework for evaluating the performance of various virtual network switching solutions for Network Function Virtualization (NFV)-like scenarios. You can read my master thesis (along with the papers I published on said work) on my [publications](/publications) page. I then graduated with a final mark of 110 cum laude/110 in October, 2019.


### Doctorate years

From October 2019 to December 2022, I've been a Ph.D. Student at [Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna](http://www.santannapisa.it) in Pisa, Italy, in the [Real-Time Systems Laboratory (ReTiS Lab)](http://retis.santannapisa.it) under the supervision of [Prof. Tommaso Cucinotta](http://retis.sssup.it/~tommaso). During this time, I also spent over 6 months abroad in Switzerland, at the [Integrated Systems Laboratory](https://iis.ee.ethz.ch) of [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch), under the supervision of [Prof. Luca Benini](https://ee.ethz.ch/the-department/people-a-z/person-detail.luca-benini.html).

My research activity focused in [Emerging Digital Technologies](http://www.santannapisa.it/en/education/international-phd-course-emerging-digital-technologies) and Embedded Systems. In particular, I conduct research on the energy consumption of real-time tasks on embedded platforms, like ARM-based devices running Linux.

Check out my [publications](/publications) page for some of the works I contributed to. My Ph.D. Thesis has already been approved, but it is currently under embargo for a couple of years, due to some topics missing a publication (yet!).

## Current Occupation

From January 2023 I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the ReTiS Lab, following up on the topics that I worked on during my Ph.D. and collaborating to an European Project, [AMPERE](https://ampere-euproject.eu).

## Prior Work Experience

### Authorship of Books and Book Chapters

On "odd" years (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021) I typically work as an independent contract author for [Zanichelli editore](http://www.zanichelli.it) (Italy).
In the past I collaborated this way to a number of projects, authoring some chapters for high-school textbooks and manuals regarding the essentials of mobile application development for Android OS. Refer to my [publications list](/publications) for the full list of my contributions.

### High-School Teaching and Tutoring

Between October 2018 and June 2019, during my senior year as a master student, I worked as a (part-time) high-school teacher for the [Istituto di Istruzione Superiore "Vespucci-Colombo"](http://vespucci.edu.it/), Livorno (Italy), teaching IT and IT Laboratory for the school year 2018-2019 to both 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> grade students.

Throughout my university years I managed to help some high school students in STEM fields as their tutor, helping them with assignments in classes such as IT, Math, Electronics, and Physics.

### Computer Assistance for Streaming and Media Recording

While studying for my Master's Degree, I also had a part-time job as a computer assistant for [University of Pisa](http://www.unipi.it) (Italy). My role was to assist technical-administrative personnel and teaching staff to provide live streaming of classes and international conferences held at University of Pisa.
