  description: This paper proposes a novel framework and programming model for real-time applications supporting a declarative access to real-time CPU scheduling features that are available on an operating system. The core idea is to let applications declare their temporal characteristics and/or requirements on the CPU allocation, where, for example, some of them may require real-time POSIX priorities, whilst others might need resource reservations through SCHED_DEADLINE. The framework can properly handle such a set of heterogeneous requirements configuring an underlying multi-core platform so to exploit the various scheduling disciplines that are available in the kernel, matching applications requirements. The framework is realized as a modular architecture in which different plugins handle independently certain real-time scheduling features within the underlying kernel, easing the customization of its behavior to support other schedulers or operating systems by adding further plugins.
