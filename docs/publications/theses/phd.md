  thesis: Doctorate Thesis in Embedded Computing Systems
  description: In this Ph.D. thesis, we address these challenges by exploring mechanisms involving (or bypassing) the OS to satisfy the performance and energy requirements of high-performance networking applications for HPC and real-time applications executing on embedded devices. We also examine the use of these mechanisms in the context of different application domains, highlighting the contrast between some enabling techniques for HPC/NFV and soft real-time applications running on embedded systems. Overall, this Ph.D. thesis contributes to various aspects of application design for cloud and edge computing.
