  description: In this thesis, a benchmarking framework has been designed and realized, for the purpose of comparing different kernel bypass mechanisms that can be used to exchange data between VNFs deployed on OS containers within a private cloud infrastructure, to determine which is the most suitable to build efficient network infrastructures in the cloud. Among these mechanisms, this work focuses on the evaluation of the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) framework and other tools that are built on top of it (e.g. software virtual switches), as DPDK occupies a prominent position in the industry and provides most of the functionalities needed to bypass the kernel when exchanging network packets, either locally or with an actual hardware Network Interface Controller (NIC). Evaluations are done comparing software virtual switches against a Single-Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) enabled network card, which provides a hardware implementation of local switching functionalities. This study compares the performance achieved by each different solution with respect to a number of key metrics, namely network throughput, latency and scalability, when subject to synthetic workloads simulating the behavior of real VNF components communicating with each other.
